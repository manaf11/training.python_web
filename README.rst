Introduction
============

This package provides the source for all lecture materials for a 10-session
course in Web Development using Python.

This package provides the source for all lecture materials used for the
`Internet Programming in Python`_ section of the `Certificate in Python
Programming`_ offered by the `University of Washington Professional &
Continuing Education`_ program. This version of the documentation is used for
the Winter 2016 instance of the course, Taught by `Cris Ewing`_

This course is taught using Python 3.

This documentation builds both an HTML version of the course lectures (for the
students) and a set of slides (for the instructor).  It uses the Python-based
documentation tool `Sphinx`_ and the `hieroglyph`_ sphinx extension. Shell
examples use `iPython` and tests are written for `pytest`. The build
environment is managed using `virtualenv` and `pip`

Building The Documentation
--------------------------

To build the documentation locally, begin by cloning the project to your
machine:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/cewing/training.python_web.git

Change directories into the repository, then create a virtualenv using Python
3:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd training.python_web
    $ virtualenv --python /path/to/bin/python3.5 .
    Running virtualenv with interpreter /path/to/bin/python3.5
    New python executable in training.python_web/bin/python3.5
    Also creating executable in training.python_web/bin/python
    Installing setuptools, pip...done.

Install the requirements for the documentation using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/pip install -r requirements.pip
    ...

Once that has successfully completed, you should be able to build both the html
documentation and the slides using the included Makefile.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make html
    ...

    Build finished. The HTML pages are in build/html.

    (webdocs)$ make slides
    ...

    Build finished. The HTML slides are in build/slides.

.. note:: If you prefer to build your virtualenvs in other ways, you will need
          to adjust the `BINDIR` variable in `Makefile` to fit your reality.
